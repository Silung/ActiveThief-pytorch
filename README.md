探究Loss上升问题；

使用数据集蒸馏方法探究生成模型是否有效。

# Getting started

ActiveThief runs on Python 2.7 using TensorFlow 1.x. The recommended Python 2 packages to install can be found in `requirements.txt`.

To download the required datasets, first run:

    python2 download_datasets.py

Then, to preprocess the ImageNet data, you must first run the following script in Python 3:

    python3 preprocess_imagenet.py

Following this, the repository is ready for use. Here is a sample command:

    python2 generic_program.py --source_model cnn_3_2 --copy_model cnn_3_2 --true_dataset mnist --noise_dataset imagenet --initial_seed 200 --k 100 --num_iter 10 --train_source_model --copy_source_model --sampling_method kcenter

Where the architecture of the model must be specified as `cnn_x_y` where `x` is the number of convolution blocks, and `y` is the number of convolutions in each block. The choices of datasets available are `mnist`, `cifar` and `gtsr` for the true dataset (aka the **secret dataset**) and `uniform` and `imagenet` for the noise dataset (aka the **thief dataset**). The query budget is specified as `initial_seed + k * num_iter`, which makes the algorithm run in `num_iter+1` iterations. The first iteration picks `initial_seed` samples, whereas in each one of the subsequent iterations, `k` samples are chosen in accordance with the `sampling_method` (aka the **subset selection strategy**). Choices of subset selection strategy available are `random`, `uncertainty`, `adversarial`, `kcenter` and `adversarial-kcenter`. By default, `random` is used.
